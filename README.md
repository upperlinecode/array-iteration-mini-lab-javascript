# Iteration

## TL;DR

This lab will give you practice iterating over arrays, a fundamental skill in dealing with larger quantities of data.

## Intro

Iterate literally means 'to perform repeatedly'. While human beings get bored of doing something repeatedly, machines excel at it.

To "iterate over an array" means to perform the same task over and over again, once for each item in the list.

The main way to iterate over a list in JavaScript is with for loops, as we saw ealier. This generally looks like:

```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < ___.length; i++) {
    // Do something with ___[i]
}
```

## The Lab

The challenges and the datasets are all in a file called `iterate.js`, so write your loops and console.log statements there.

Run your code after each challenge to check that everything works, and then consider commenting out your console.logs so you don't have to sift through lots of previous outputs each time.
